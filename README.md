# llamabot

llamabot helps you recognize achievements and give thanks to your Slack workspace buddies in a fun way!

Give a shout-out to someone in any channel that llamabot is in, and include some :llama: emojis.

```
@stevejobs thanks for the sick phone! :llama :llama :llama
```

Just like that, I awarded @stevejobs 3 llamas. Every user has a limited number to give each day, and a leaderboard is kept.
